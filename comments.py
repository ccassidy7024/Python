#Python Program calculating miles per gallon

# Define amount of gallons the vehicle tank holds
tank_size = 15
# Define the total distance covered
distance = 600
# Calculate miles per gallon
mpg = distance / tank_size
# Print the solution of the amount of miles traveled by the amount of 
# gallons of fuel the vehicle holds to find out how many miles per gallon you can travel
print("Miles per gallon:", mpg)
